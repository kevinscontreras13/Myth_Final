        <h1>Project Commentary</h1>
        <p>
            The idea of a mythological dating site emerged from our class discussions on mythological themes, particularly feminism, anthropomorphism, and character growth. In exploring Greek mythology, I was struck by the human-like emotions and interactions of gods, their complex relationships, and the sociocultural reflections embedded in these tales. This project aimed to reimagine those interactions in a contemporary format: a playful, interactive dating site where users could match with mythological figures like Athena, Poseidon, or Odysseus himself.
This concept ties directly into our analysis of anthropomorphism among gods. Mythological figures, despite their divine origins, often embody exaggerated human traits like jealousy, love, and vengeance making them relatable. Feminism also played a key role, as I crafted profiles that subverted traditional gender norms found in myths, presenting figures like Athena and Calypso as strong, independent entities not defined solely by their relationships. This is especially exemplified in Calypso’s profile quote where she feels unjustly judged for sleeping with her potential partner. Finally, the growth of characters, such as Telemachus or Odysseus, informed how I structured the profiles to show a deeper understanding of each mythological figure’s journey and development. Telemachus, for example, has grown to become the man of his house over time and shown that he does not necessarily have a love interest, but he is actively looking for courage and kleos.
Initially, the project was designed using a third-party website builder. However, the limitations of pre-built templates became apparent. These tools restricted creative freedom and couldn’t support my vision for an interactive user experience. After some deliberation, I pivoted to building the site from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This decision significantly extended the project timeline. Learning and implementing the technical aspects of web design, especially JavaScript for interactive features was challenging, but with the help of some YouTube videos and generative AI models, I was able to debug my code successfully and find cool ways to display the characters’ personalities.Despite these hurdles, the process allowed for a tailored design that still encapsulated the project’s themes and creativity.
Looking ahead, the project could evolve into a fully functional matching platform, complete with a live algorithm calculating compatibility percentages based on user inputs. This could involve creating a backend system to analyze preferences and integrating dynamic features like real-time chat options with selected mythological matches. Additionally, incorporating a wider range of mythologies (Norse, Egyptian, etc.) would enrich the user experience and provide a more global perspective on myths.
Beyond technical enhancements, deeper engagement with thematic elements is a possibility. For instance, a feature highlighting the cultural and feminist critiques of each mythological figure could provide an educational layer to the interactive experience.
This project was both challenging and rewarding. It bridged our classroom discussions on mythology’s timeless relevance with modern digital storytelling. While the technical pivot tested our adaptability, it ultimately enabled a richer, more authentic realization of our vision. The mythological dating site celebrates the enduring fascination with these stories while engaging users in a playful yet thought-provoking exploration of their themes. As an exercise, I analyzed some of these profiles and came up with general categories of who you may match with.

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>For intellectual equals: Athena or Odysseus. They’ll keep you mentally engaged with their wit and wisdom.</li>
            <li>For nurturing souls: Telemachus or Penelope. Both value growth and stability, though they offer it in different ways.
            </li>
            <li>For adventurers: Odysseus or Poseidon. Both offer excitement, though one comes with clever plans and the other with raw energy.
            </li>
            <li>For romantics: Calypso or Penelope. If you love timeless devotion, they are your ideal match.
